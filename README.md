# eCommerce Shop - MERN Stack

This repository contains a full-stack eCommerce shop developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The project utilizes modern web technologies to build a feature-rich online store.

## Features

- **MongoDB Atlas:** The shop integrates with MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted database service, to store and manage product data.

- **JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are implemented for secure user authentication and authorization, providing a seamless and protected shopping experience.

- **Product Management:** The shop enables administrators to easily manage product listings, including creating, updating, and deleting products.

- **Shopping Cart Functionality:** Users can add products to their shopping cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout for a smooth purchasing process.

- **Secure API Endpoints:** The backend utilizes Express.js to create secure API endpoints for handling user requests, ensuring data privacy and integrity.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL document-oriented database used for data storage and management.
- Express.js: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust backend infrastructure.
- React: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create a dynamic and interactive frontend.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes server-side code, allowing the backend to run on a single language.
- JWT: JSON Web Tokens are employed for secure authentication and authorization between the client and server.
